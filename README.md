# People Analytics

Classification of People Profiling based on Age,Gender,Religion and Caste. 
 .
Classification on Socio economic Status 
- Socio-economic status is a major determinant of the kind of messages people would respond to and the way they’d choose whom to vote for. 
- A lot of datasets, like land records, BPL lists, surveys by the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) and census data, can provide this information. 
- Proxies, such as electricity bills, also can be used to judge a person’s economic status. A person’s electricity bill is directly correlated with their income since people with high income often consume more electricity with gadgets and appliances like air conditioners and geysers and hence have higher bills, while the poor have relatively fewer electrical appliances to consume electricity. 
- After carrying out such classification, the voters can be fed with targeted messaging


Social media text Sentiment Classification

- Crawling tweets from hashtags of parties, party leaders, and news channels will enable us to gauge the mood of the voters.
- Also, comments from the youtube videos can be crawled and classified to gauge the sentiment.
- Using NLP and sentimental analysis, target messages can be sent to a voter through the social media platform of his choice such as Facebook, Whatsapp group, etc.
- An individual with negligible social media presence can be targeted through voice recordings or SMS

Challenge: Getting the phone numbers of the voters. Also linking the voters name to his/her social media id

Crawling Goverment Websites for Complaints

- This will enable us to find the key issues and the sentiments of the complaints posted on such websites.
- The complaints can be used to customize messages to individuals from a particular booth area.
